<h5>In user interface design for computer applications, a modal window is a graphical control element subordinate to an application's main window. A modal window creates a mode that disables the main window but keeps it visible, with the modal window as a child window in front of it.</h5>
<h1><b>How it works</b></h1>
<h5>
Before getting started with Bootstrap’s modal component, be sure to read the following as our menu options have recently changed.<br/>
<ul>
<li>Modals are built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They’re positioned over everything else in the document and remove scroll from the <body> so that modal content scrolls instead.</li>
<li>Clicking on the modal “backdrop” will automatically close the modal.</li>
<li>Bootstrap only supports one modal window at a time. Nested modals aren’t supported as we believe them to be poor user experiences.</li>
<li>Modals use position: fixed, which can sometimes be a bit particular about its rendering. Whenever possible, place your modal HTML in a top-level position to avoid potential interference from other elements. You’ll likely run into issues when nesting a .modal within another fixed element.</li>
<li>Once again, due to position: fixed, there are some caveats with using modals on mobile devices. See our browser support docs for details.</li>
<li>Due to how HTML5 defines its semantics, the autofocus HTML attribute has no effect in Bootstrap modals.</li>
</ul>
